# [Daudixâ€™s Blog](https://daudix.one)

This is the source code for personal website. It is powered by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) and [Duckquill](https://duckquill.daudix.one).

## FOR FUCK'S SAKE READ THIS

If you like how my website looks and want to make your own based on it: DON'T.

Seriously, just use the [Duckquill](https://duckquill.daudix.one) theme; I'm the author of it and it's literally the same thing as this website minus all my crap. Save your nerves, I'm serious.

If you want to use some custom styles and stuff from here, go ahead, just don't make it *too similar,* I got to have a little uniqueness :^)
