So uh yeah, I kinda forgot about this thing for a month, sorry. This month I've been working hard on [Ametrine](https://ametrine.daudix.one), participated in [HighSeas](https://highseas.hackclub.com) and won some prizes, and... that's about it. I plan on writing about HighSeas once I get (or don't) said prizes, and plan on porting this site to Ametrine and releasing its first alpha before the end of the month. Oh and yesterday I caught flu, yay.
