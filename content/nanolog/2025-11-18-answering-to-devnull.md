As you might know I have this silly thingy on a homepage where one can [send me a push notification](@/home/index.md#ntfy), and a bunch of folks actually did send some! Some of them are actually questions, so I figured, what if I answered these as an unasked Q&A? Before that I'd like to turn this thingy into an actual guestbook, but I'm not quite sold on this one yet.
