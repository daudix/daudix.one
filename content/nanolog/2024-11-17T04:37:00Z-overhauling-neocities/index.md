Guess who's writing this at 4AM.

I've started porting my [Neocities site](https://daudix.neocities.org) to [Zola](https://www.getzola.org); it works already (it took me like 5min), but it'll take much more time to make it actually clean and pleasant to use, as right now it's a hot mess of ugly HTML and confusing CSS. I have some grand (not actually) plans for it, so yeah, stay tuned.
