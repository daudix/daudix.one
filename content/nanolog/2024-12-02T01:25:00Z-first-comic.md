Yesterday I've [drawn my first comic](https://pleroma.envs.net/notice/AobomUGxyXvePnkg9g) (as per [this](https://pleroma.envs.net/notice/AoaCZtXCka6laBxJRI) poll). The drawing is this shitty on purpose, if I wanted to I could do better ;)

Honestly I kinda liked doing it, might do it some more.

![A comic panel. On first panel there's digital clock with the time 09:30, behind it there's a window with sun and a cloud. On second panel there's a square guy with a very tired face and text "Literally half-dead". On third panel there's the same clock and window, but time is 01:00. On fourth panel there's the same guy but with excited face and text "Never felt more alive".](https://pleroma.envs.net/media/bb309e256f39f6d6a0f1872c33165eb93f138163ad2f140000842d505923fc29.png)
