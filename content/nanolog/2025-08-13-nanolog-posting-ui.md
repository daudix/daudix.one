Okay so, I've been working on a web UI for posting nanologs/nanoposts, as the [CLI I made earlier](@/nanolog/2025-01-21-nanolog-cli.md) wasn't very nice and was super weird on mobile. Now I have a nice little dialog that allows me to do so without leaving this site, pretty neat. While at it, I have simplified nanolog structure so that every post is a single text file and not a folder with index.md file, this means I can no longer attach images, which is on purpose. Okay I hit the 500 char limit.
