Today is one of those days when you go down some random rabbit hole, this time it's about fonts and icons.

First, I found an amazing font called [Departure Mono](https://departuremono.com) made by the [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com) creator; [Helena](https://www.helenazhang.com). Not only the font itself is gorgerous, the site itself is spectacular too, which is no surprise considering it's made by the same person that made Phosphor Icons website; [Tobias](https://tobiasfried.com). Why am I naming the creators and providing links? because that's part of the journey!

Next up I came across [the hardest working font in Manhattan](https://aresluna.org/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/), and it's been a great read with lots of beautiful photos, check them out even if you don't plan on reading the whole thing, even though I heavily recommend doing so.

Lastly, I came across [Micro Bold Icons](https://nucleoapp.com/micro-bold-icons) mentioned on one of Helena's posts about [best new icons of 2024](https://minoraxis.medium.com/best-new-icons-of-2024-4d54726e3f86). It's such a great icon library and it's exactly what I needed for [Ametrine](https://ametrine.daudix.one), however it's paid, so I'll continue using Phosphor Icons, they're great too.

And after writing the above chunk of text, I've read [nobody cares](https://grantslatton.com/nobody-cares), I forgot how I came across it, but yeah, it really does suck that many people really just don't care :<

P.S. What's funny about this entire journey is that it all started with me looking up "more" icons on Phosphor Icons website XD
