Been fixing my sleep schedule in the past three days; friends are all busy and my mental state is pretty bad so it's a perfect opportunity. Been assisting myself with melatonin+magnesium, multivit, and vitamin e pills, and they seem to actually help, I'm falling asleep pretty much instantly, which is pretty unusual as I usually first go through a (mini) panic attack. Today I overslept though, and by this I mean *really* overslept, buuut it's okay, I didn't have any like, super serious plans xD
