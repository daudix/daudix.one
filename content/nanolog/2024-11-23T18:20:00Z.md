You know, I want to make the [Neocities site](https://daudix.neocities.org) its own thing; with different content, style, *vibe*, and whatnot, but in order for it to be somewhat useful, I have to duplicate content from this site, which is like the opposite of my goal {{ emoji(name="neofox_cry") }}. Of course I could just link to this site, but then, what's the point of having an alt site in the first place? It's so annoying (just like I am).
