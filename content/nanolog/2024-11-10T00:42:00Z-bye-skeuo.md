Today I've tried to fix the [coffee page](@/coffee/index.md) styling after the recent refactoring, and I've realized that I really don't want to mess with all these broken hacky styles, so I've just [got rid of it](https://codeberg.org/daudix/website/commit/61ada77f5c83bac4161d8f640c2779f2a6a27860). Sadge. It might come back in slightly different form later on, but not now.
