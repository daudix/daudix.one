Another one of my crazy ideas: what if this nanolog was stored on atproto, and was fetched from some api on build? or even crazier, what if we used https://leaflet.pub to post nanologs, and this would just display them? I'd have the ease of leaflet and would have total control over the looks. Unlikely to happen, but also, hmm.
