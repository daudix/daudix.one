Turned out Zola generates the feed for all sections if `generate_feeds` is set in the config and not per section, so I had to split it to separate feeds for the blog and this nanolog, which will require everyone to update it in their feed reader. Damn. Oh and yeah I renamed this thing back to nanolog since it sounds cooler.
