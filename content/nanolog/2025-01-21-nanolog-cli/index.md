Alright, I've been putting this post away for three days, for no reason, so yeah here we go.

I've made a CLI [tool](https://codeberg.org/daudix/Nanolog) for posting nanoposts (nanolog posts?) with [Gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) for UI, and it's basically just a bash script. I've got the idea of using Gum from Sam while they were working on [Gir](https://github.com/Icycoide/Gir) (very swag tool btw check it out). The idea is to make nanoposting easier and faster, thus reduce my Mastodon usage, thus having more control over my posts or something, I'll write a post about this sometime.

Anyhow, this post was written entirely from terminal using said tool; a bit tricky without spellchecking and having the edit area 6 line high, but could be worse. It doesn't really make the process significantly faster, but why not make stuff more painful for no reason.

Now that this post is written I can finally nanopost something else, as it was stopping me from doing so.

P.S. Here's a short demo:
