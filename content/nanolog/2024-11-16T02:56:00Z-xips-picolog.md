A buddy of mine has added a [picolog](https://xip.neocities.org/picolog/) to his website, which is like a nanolog, but smaller, which is a microblog, but smaller, which is a blog, but smaller... Sorry I got carried away. It's pretty fun to see the *log minification spread {{ emoji(name="neofox_3c") }}. And yeah we got custom emojis now {{ emoji(name="neofox_googly_shocked") }}. *Aaaaa*.
