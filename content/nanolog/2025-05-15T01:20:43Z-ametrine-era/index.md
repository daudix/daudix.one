Alright so, I have finally deployed the new daudix.one based on [Ametrine](https://ametrine.daudix.one), which is a work of the last 4 months, longest of course was the work on Ametrine itself. Content changed a bit, but no drastic changes so far, but there are exciting updates on their way, such as /blog/ content rewamp. uyiiii i'm so excited x33

Make sure to check out the new [badges](@/badges/index.md) page btw
