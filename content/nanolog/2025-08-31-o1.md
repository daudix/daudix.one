Now that the cat is out of the bag as I spoiled it in a couple of placesâ€¦

Yes, I have a new personal brand! It's nothing like what I had before and it's not designed by me!

Currently adding all the needed remaining brand assets, afterwards I plan to write a blog post about this, which will be accompanied with me actually putting the new brand into circulation. I also want to make a short animation showing all the brand features, but it's much harder than I anticipated, so it might not happen.
