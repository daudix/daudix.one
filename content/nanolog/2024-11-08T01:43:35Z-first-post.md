This is a first post in this microblog that is inspired by [gettie's](https://getimiskon.xyz/microblog.html); it's kinda like a blog, but smaller. I will (or not) write some posts here that don't exactly deserve their own blog post with a banner and such.

Oh and these posts need no front matter at all, only date in the file name and a title, which isn't seen anywhere except the URL, which cannot be disabled for some reason, so I've turned it into a feature (that button up in the corner).
