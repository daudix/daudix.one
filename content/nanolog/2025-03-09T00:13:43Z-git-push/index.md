Testing something out, if everything works this post should be created and pushed to the [website](https://github.com/daudix/daudix.one) repo automatically by the [nanolog](https://codeberg.org/daudix/nanolog) tool.

Or it'll nuke the entire repo, idk.

[7 edits omitted]  
Edit #7: Turned out I was using an old version of the script and didn't properly export the GIT_DIR variable, hopefully it'll work now.  
Edit #8: I hate Git so so much.
