Lately my site has grew in site quite a bit; I [switched](@/nanolog/2024-11-13-geist-font/index.md) to a custom web font, added some Gir stamps, and such. This made the site weight around 1MB, which isn't a lot, but twice the [512KB limit](https://512kb.club), so I've made a tough decision and axed all the stamps and renamed the section on the homepage from "Bumps" to "Badges". Sad, but I won't get id of them entirely; I plan to move them to [my spacehey](https://spacehey.com/daudix) (somehow, idk), feel free to friend me there btw.
