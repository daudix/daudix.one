Implemented a feature I've been thinking for a while now; all posts that have a banner now use color picked from it as their accent instead of site's default, and post cards in the article list are colored as well. Looks pretty neat IMO. Oh and yeah I'm writing this at 1AM again, borked sleep schedule and stuff.
