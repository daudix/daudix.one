Just uninstalled TikTok, againâ€¦
I've been spending an hour+ on it daily, and while it might not seem like a lot for some, it's actually a bunch of time --- pretty much an entire full-length movie! And so, I want to redirect that time from one form of entertainment to another, a bit more healthy one; watch some movies, finish watching a few shows that I abandoned, maybe watch YouTube? And yes, I could spend it productively, but we all know it won't actually work, at least I'll be slightly happer.
