Updated my [New Era](@/blog/2025-07-16-new-era/index.md) post to include a couple new images and an entirely new section. See [this commit](https://github.com/daudix/daudix.one/commit/637bd7ef6f7acd53f5346104e5cc291ed5cc7968) for a detailed overview.

With this edit this post is what I intended it to be from the very start. Yes, it's been a month, but I'd rather edit it now than leave it in a bit undercooked state.
