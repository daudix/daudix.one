Once again I've sat down to write a blog post and ended up doing completely unrelated things. This time I have shortened homepage by moving unnecessary info to about page, which I have got rid of a while ago, and redesigned the works section (that window with rainbow text is now on about page). Design is pretty heavily inspired by [Volpeon's](https://volpeon.ink) site, but also it's very different so I guess it's fine.
