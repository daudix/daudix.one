Forgot to mention, site's source code has been, well, nuked. Codeberg [introduced](https://blog.codeberg.org/new-storage-limits-on-codeberg-what-you-need-to-know.html) new repo size limits, basically personal repos that don't really benefit anyone will be limited to just 100MB, and since mine weights twice as much, I had to move it somewhere else, aka private GitHub repo. It'll be the case until I figure things out, but yeah, I didn't want to risc it since the Codeberg changes will take effect starting tomorrow.

<small>I know I said this on Discord and Bluesky already, but it's a pretty important change so an entry in nanolog wouldn't hurt.</small>
