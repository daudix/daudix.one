1. **Be Friendly and Respectful**  
This space is meant to be friendly and welcoming, so please keep it that way.
2. **Be Patient**  
Everyone's different in variety of ways, remember that.
3. **Be Careful with Heated Topics**  
If you know in advance that a certain topic will quickly escalate or derail, please refrain from starting it. Political discussions are allowed as long as you keep it civil and don't make it personal.
4. **No Toxicity, Doxxing, and Traumadumping**  
Seriously, we have enough of that already. There is a difference between venting and traumadumping, but as it's pretty blurry try to keep it to a minimum.
5. **No NSFW or Suggestive Content**  
As per [Discord's TOS](https://discord.com/terms/#2), this server can be viewed by anyone as young as 13.
6. **Keep Conversations in English**  
Many members are polyglots, but not all. The use of foreign languages also makes moderation more difficult. However, if the conversation is mainly in English and a member, for example, asks for the meaning of a particular foreign word, that's fine.
7. **Limit Unnecessary Use of Profanity**  
You know what that means; pointless swearing out of habit.
8. **Don't Encourage Others in Breaking the Rules**  
Doing so will count as breaking the rule by yourself.
9. **Don't Spam and Don't Mention Users without Need**  
Even if the spam is unintentional, automated moderation can think it is.
10. **Don't Try to Find Loopholes in the Rules**  
Want to speedrun getting banned? Just ask `@Moderator` to do so.

The rules may be changed at any time. Improvement proposals are welcome.

## Punishment

Generally, before any serious punishment, users will be warned three times:

- **First warning:** 30 minutes mute.
- **Second warning:** 1 day mute.
- **Third warning:** Kick.

If the user continues to be nasty, they will be:

- Banned with appeal.
- Permanently banned.

However, if the user's actions are too nasty, levels may be skipped depending on the severity of the nastiness.

## Appeal

If you feel that you have been unfairly punished, feel free to discuss it with the [admin](@/find/index.md#contacts) or the moderator behind this. Misunderstandings happen.
