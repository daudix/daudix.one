1. **Be Friendly and Respectful**  
This space is meant to be friendly and welcoming, so please keep it that way.
2. **Drama, Toxicity, Doxxing, Suicide Threats, and Such Are Prohibited**  
Seriously, we have enough of that already.
3. **No NSFW or Overly Suggestive Content**  
At the end of the day, this server can be viewed by anyone as young as 13.
4. **Be Careful with Heated Topics**  
If you know in advance that one topic or another will quickly derail, please refrain from starting it. Political discussions are allowed as long as you keep it civil and don't make it personal.
5. **Limit the Use of Strong Language without a Reason**  
You know what I mean; pointless swearing out of habit. Occasional swearing is okay.
6. **Keep Conversations in English**  
Many of us are polyglots, but not all. This also makes moderation more difficult. An occasional word or two in a foreign language is fine, though.
7. **Don't Spam**  
Even if the spam is unintentional, automated moderation can think it is. Be careful.
8. **Be Patient**  
Everyone's different in variety of ways, remember that. Please.
9. **Don't Test the Limits**  
Want to speedrun getting banned? Just ask `@Moderator` to do it LMAO.

The rules may be changed at any time. Improvement proposals are welcome.

## Punishment

Generally, before any serious punishment, users will be warned three times:

- **First warning:** 30 minutes mute.
- **Second warning:** 1 day mute.
- **Third warning:** Kick.

If the user continues to be nasty, they will be:

- Banned with appeal.
- Permanently banned.

However, if the user's actions are too nasty, levels may be skipped depending on the severity of the nastiness.

## Appeal

If you feel that you have been unfairly punished, feel free to discuss it with the [admin](@/find/index.md#contacts) or the moderator behind this. Misunderstandings happen.
