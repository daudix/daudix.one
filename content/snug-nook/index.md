Hi, nice to see you here ^^

Ever wanted to join yet another Discord server for fun and giggles? Hate Discord and prefer Matrix instead? Worry not, We got you all covered!

is the very server that is available on both Discord and Matrix, allowing seamless<sup>*</sup> communication. Gluten-free and is proven safe by the FDA.

<small>*Almost, it's a bit unstable at times.</small>

Read about its creation and the motivation behind it [here](@/blog/2024-10-31-snug-nook/index.md).

There's nothing special about this server in itself, what's special is the wonderful people on it. Still, this server is meant to be cozy, welcoming, and friendly, which means toxicity, doxxing, drama, suicide threats, <span class="spoiler">NSFW</span>, and the like are not welcome.

Besides, I just wanted to try running a server, because why not? I like chatting with cool people and I don't like the stuff mentioned above, so yeah. There's probably a server out there that ticks all the boxes that I just don't know about, if so, [let me know](@/find/index.md#contacts).

![Server avatar; half of "neofox googly shocked" and "neocat googly shocked" on a violet background.](avatar.png#end#spoiler)

Okay okay, I didn't think we'd get this far, but I have something to convince you; we got a fun server avatar, just look at it!

Isn't it wonderful, spectacular, and extremely fops-car? ^w^ :3

Heck, you didn't even pick the color, it's just ["Lavender"](https://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/#B57EDC)!

I see... we also have:

- Memeboard
- Ananas Duck
- Hall of... Shame
- Most of my friends
- Duckquill updates and devlog channel
- No voice channels, that's right, shy folks
- Time zone roles that no other server has
- Custom emojis on both Discord and Matrix
- Color roles that every other server also has

Plus we got "locations" metaphor; `#general` and `#welcome`? Nope. We have `#living-room` and `#hallway`!

Nuh-uh, you have to read the [rules](@/snug-nook/rules.md) first :3c
