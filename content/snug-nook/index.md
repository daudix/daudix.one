Hi, nice to see you here ^^

Ever wanted to join yet another Discord server for fun and giggles? Hate Discord and prefer Matrix instead? Worry not, I got you all covered! <span class="rainboom">**Snug Nook**</span> is the very server that is available on both Discord and Matrix, allowing seamless<sup>*</sup> communication. Gluten-free and is proven safe by the FDA.

<small>*Almost, it's a bit unstable at times.</small>

This server is meant to be cozy, welcoming, and friendly, which means toxicity, doxxing, drama, suicide threats, <span class="spoiler">NSFW</span>, and the like are not welcome.

Besides, I just wanted to try running a server, because why not? I like chatting with cool people and I don't like the stuff mentioned above, so yeah. There's probably a server out there that ticks all the boxes that I just don't know about, if so, [let me know](@/find/index.md#contacts).

Okay okay, I didn't think we'd get this far, but I have something to convince you; we got a fun server avatar, just look at it!

Isn't it wonderful, spectacular, and extremely fops? ^w^

I see... We also have:

- ??? room
- Starboard
- Memeboard
- Duckquill and this website
- Color roles that every other server also has

Uh, this works too? Here, choose your pill:

{% alert(note=true) %}
Keep in mind that this server is still in a "beta" state and some things may not work as expected, sorry about that.

{% alert(fact=true) %}
In the process of setting up the Matrix mirror and adding the "Abuse Management" bot, I managed to get on the nerves of the homerver moderator because the bot is in fact not a bot and is manually added and approved, so I got called out publicly. As usual, I'm unintentionally causing trouble in the process of doing something, classic me.
