Hi, nice to see you here ^^

Ever wanted to join yet another Discord server for fun and giggles? Hate Discord and prefer Matrix instead? Worry not, I got you all covered! <span class="rainboom">**Daudix's Snug Nook**</span> is the very server that is available on both Discord and Matrix, allowing seamless<sup>*</sup> communication. Gluten-free and is proven safe by the FDA.

<small>*Almost, it's a bit unstable at times.</small>

> What is so special about this server? There are other servers like this, smh...

This server is meant to be cozy, welcoming, and friendly, which means toxicity, doxxing, drama, suicide threats, <span class="spoiler">NSFW</span>, and the like are not welcome.

Besides, I just wanted to try running a server, because why not? I like chatting with cool people and I don't like the stuff mentioned above, so yeah. There's probably a server out there that ticks all the boxes that I just don't know about, if so, let me know.

> What else? I'm not convinced, stop wasting my time!

Okay okay, I didn't think we'd get this far, but I have something to convince you; we got a fun server avatar, just look at it!

Isn't it spectacular, wonderful, simply divine, and extremely fops? ^w^

> Not convinced, you can't buy me with a [Neofox](https://volpeon.ink/emojis/neofox/) on violet background.

I see... We also have:

- ??? room
- Starboard
- Memeboard
- Duckquill and this website
- Color roles that every other server also has

> Ughhh, fiiine. You're so miserable, I'm only joining this damn server because I feel bad for you.

Uh, this works too? Here, choose your pill:

{% alert(fact=true) %}
In the process of setting up the Matrix mirror and adding the "Abuse Management" bot, I managed to get on the nerves of the homerver moderator because the bot is in fact not a bot and is manually added and approved, so I got called out publicly. As usual, I'm causing trouble in the process of doing something, classic me.
