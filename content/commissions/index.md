Open slots: <mark>4/4</mark> (Small Scale) â€¢ <mark>2/2</mark> (Large Scale)

Hello and welcome to my commissions page. Here you can commission me to do a wide range of designs, including but not limited to: logos, icons, personal websites, motion design and video editing.

You can see some of my decent work on the [design](@/design/index.md) page.

I am familiar with the following creative applications

- Inkscape - Vector graphics
- Blender - 3D modelling
- Krita - Digital art
- Kdenlive - Video editing
- GIMP - Photo editing
- Darktable - Photo colour correction
- Aseprite - Pixel art

Please note that I am learning these on the fly. If I can't do something, I simply learn it.

## Important Information

### Payment and Pricing

- **Payment will be accepted trough Ko-fi or Paypal.** We will discuss the pricing, project requirements, etc. and create basic sketches, mood boards, color palettes, and fonts for free. I prefer doing 50-50 (pay 50% of the price when I start and 50% afterwards).
- **I will only start working on the commission we agreed on after the payment.** Again, 50% of the total price (the reasoning behind this is clear I suppose). The rest should be paid after you are happy with the end result and would like to receive the full-resolution, watermark-less version.
- **If you are not happy with the end result or I cannot finish the commission, I will promptly refund said 50%.** That said, I will do my absolute best to make you happy with the end result and get it to the finish line.
- **If the actual cost exceeds the estimate (e.g. more revisions are required), I may ask for extra.** If the actual cost is *below* the estimate, I may return some money back.

### Timing

- **Response time is usually 12-36 hours.** If I don't respond in said time, that means that I have a strong reason for this. If any project takes more time than estimate we agreed upon, I will let you know.
- **While I will provide estimate completion time, no exact deadlines will be provided.** This is simply not feasible because different people have different response time, require more or less revisions, and complexity can vary.
- **Wait time can be anything from 24 hours to a few months.** Again, everything varies from the commission complexity and requirements. I will, however, do my best to complete it as fast as I can.

### Process

- **I will regularly send you WIP pictures to let you know of current progress.** You may ask for the source files at any time. Layers, if present, will *not* be named unless specified. Named layers may cost around 5% of the agreed price depending on complexity.
- **I will take your feedback seriously.** However, you should understand that I can't make countless revisions.

## What I Can Do

{% alert(note=true) %}

{% end %}

### Personal Website

#### Duckquill-Based

Small Scale: <mark>$8-$16</mark>

[Duckquill](https://duckquill.daudix.one)-powered website. 1-8 page layouts at a flat rate of $8-$16 + $2 per additional page. Using only already available Duckquill features (which are many).

Large Scale: <mark>$16-$32</mark>

[Duckquill](https://duckquill.daudix.one)-powered website. 8-32 page layouts at a flat rate of $16-$32 + $2 per additional page. You can request changes to the Duckquill look and as many custom elements as you need for 5% of the agreed price.

#### Custom

Small Scale: <mark>$32-$64<sup>*</sup></mark>

1-8 page layouts at a rate of $32-$64 flat fee + $4 per additional page. All pages are responsive to display properly on both desktop and mobile. Simpler design without complex styles.

Large Scale: <mark>$64-$128<sup>*</sup></mark>

8-32 page layouts at a rate of $64-$128 flat fee + $4 per additional page. All pages are responsive to display properly on both desktop and mobile. More complex design with well-designed styles.

<small><sup>*</sup>Highest estimated total cost includes all fees.</small>

{% alert(note=true) %}
- I do static websites only, either hand-written or with use of one of the popular SSGs (Zola, Jekyll, or Hugo). No JavaScript is used unless needed. Auto light/dark mode switching based on OS preference comes by default, and manual toggle will cost extra $4.
- I can "host" the site on Neocities with no custom domain. However, you are free to get the site files and host it somewhere else.
- Website doesn't include custom graphics such as favicon and metadata card in "Small Scale" plan. You can order them separately, and I might make a (great) discount for you.

### Motion Design

Small Scale: <mark>$24-$48</mark>

Short (up to 90 seconds) video made in Blender, either 2D or featuring some 3D elements.

### Video Editing

Small Scale: <mark>$12-$48</mark>

Simple edit of provided footage; cutting, color grading, fading, you name it. No complex FX. Simple FX such as chroma keying can be considered. If the video is longer than 10 minutes, each additional minite will cost 5% of the agreed price.
