Hello and welcome to my commissions page. Here you can commission me to do a wide range of designs, including but not limited to: logos, personal websites, motion design, and video editing.

You can see some of my work on the [design](@/design/index.md) page.

I work with the following creative applications and I’m always learning to better meet the needs of your project:

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Vector graphics
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org) - 3D modelling
- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) - Digital art
- [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org) - Video editing
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) - Photo editing
- [Darktable](https://www.darktable.org) - Photo color correction
- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org) - Pixel art

## Policy

### Payment and Pricing

- **Only commission me if you have the means to pay.** We’ll first discuss your project requirements, and I’ll create basic sketches, mood boards, color palettes, and fonts for free. I prefer doing 50-50 (50% upfront and 50% after the project is complete).
- **Payment will be accepted through Ko-fi or PayPal.** I will start working after the first 50% payment is received. The remaining 50% should be paid once you're happy with the final result and wish to receive the full-resolution, watermark-free version.
- **If you are not happy with the end result or I cannot finish the commission, I will refund the initial 50%.** That said, I will do my absolute best to get it to the finish line and make you happy with the end result.
- **If the project requires more revisions than originally discussed, I may ask for an additional fee.** If the total cost is less than estimated, I’ll refund the difference.

### Timing

- **Response time is usually 24-48 hours.** If I don’t respond within this time, there’s likely a good reason, and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.
- **While I will provide estimate completion time, no exact deadlines will be provided.** This is simply not feasible because different people have different response time, require more or less revisions, and complexity varies from one commission to another.

### Process

- **I will regularly send work-in-progress pictures** to keep you updated on the progress. You may request source files after final payment is made.
- **Layers will not be named unless specified.** If you need them named, it may cost 5% more, depending on the project complexity.
- **I will take your feedback seriously.** However, if the number of revisions exceeds the norm, I may ask for an additional fee.
