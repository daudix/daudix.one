Hello and welcome to my commissions page. Here you can commission me to do a wide range of designs, including but not limited to: logos, personal websites, motion design, and video editing.

You can see some of my work on the [design](@/design/index.md) page.

I work with the following creative applications and I’m always learning to better meet the needs of your project:

## Key Information

<div class="card-grid big">

<!-- Card start -->
<div class="card">
<strong class="title">Payment and Pricing</strong>

<div class="card-content">
<div class="fancy-list">

- **Only commission me if you have the means to pay.**  
Discount for students, non-profits, and returning customers is present.
- **Payment will be accepted through Ko-fi or PayPal.**  
Cash App, Stripe and Crypto are not accepted; I don't and can't have the former two and the latter is more difficult to refund and confirm.
- **I prefer doing 50-50 (50% upfront and 50% upon completion).**  
I will start working after the first 50% payment is received. The remaining 50% should be paid once you're happy with the final result and wish to receive the full-resolution, watermark-free version.
- **If you are not happy with the end result or I cannot finish the commission, I will refund the initial 50%.**  
That said, I will do my absolute best to get it to the finish line and make you happy with the end result.
- **If the project requires more revisions than originally discussed, I may ask for an additional fee.**  
If the total cost is less than estimated, I’ll refund the difference.

<div class="card">
<strong class="title">Timing</strong>

<div class="card-content">
<div class="fancy-list">

- **Response time is usually 24-48 hours.**  
If I don’t respond within this time, there’s likely a good reason, and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.
- **While I will provide estimate completion time, no exact deadlines will be provided.**  
This is simply not feasible because different people have different response time, require more or less revisions, and complexity varies from one commission to another.
- **Queue wait time can be anything from 24 hours to a few months.**  
That said, I will do my best to complete it as fast as I can.

<div class="card">
<strong class="title">Process</strong>

<div class="card-content">
<div class="fancy-list">

- **I will regularly send work-in-progress pictures to keep you updated on the progress.**  
Images will have a prominent watermark and will be in a lower resolution than the final result.
- **Layers will not be named unless specified.**  
If you need them named, it may cost 5% more, depending on the project complexity.
- **I will take your feedback seriously.**  
However, keep in mind that the number of revisions is finite.
- **Final delivery as a ZIP file with all the sources in place.**  
Websites will have full source code and instructions on how to build them, logos will have SVG source files, etc.

<strong class="title">Other Details</strong>

<div class="card-content">
<div class="fancy-list">

- **I have the right to decline any commission that goes against my values or makes me uncomfortable.**  
I suppose there's no need to explain why.
- **Logos will be exported in PNG & SVG.**  
Export in additional formats such as PDF are available upon request.
- **Only freely licensed fonts are used.**  
Fonts will either be available on Google Fonts or one of the code forges.
- **Websites come with a light and dark modes based on OS preference by default.**  
Manual toggle will cost $4-$8 extra.
- **I don’t provide hosting, but I can help with this.** If you use GitHub/GitLab/Codeberg pages or Vercel, you're in luck.
- **Website graphics (favicon, metadata card) are not included.**  
You can however, order these separately with a sweet discount.
- **No JavaScript is used unless necessary.**  
This not only improves speed, but also ensures that the website uses only well-defined HTML elements.
