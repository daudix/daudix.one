## <i class="bi bi-info-circle"></i> About

Hello there! My name is David, you may know me by my online handle Daudix.

> Although Daudix may appear as just my online handle, it's actually slightly different persona; perhaps more silly and honest than the more "official" David, but they're so tightly tied together so it's fine to use whatever you like.

I'm from the Siberian part of Russia, but currently live in ▒▓░▒▓░ (if you know you know).

Some things I like:

- Photography; although I don't have much opportunity to shoot anything else than a view from my window
- Design
- Open source
- Retro and vintage stuff, as well as retro-futurism

My favorite games are:

- Portal series
- Untitled Goose
- The Stanley Parable
- Stardew Valley
- Cyberpunk 2077 (I only played it on YouTube so it's still to be played haha)

Design is a perhaps a bit more than just a thing I like, it's my hobby that I learn more about every day.

I'm also in process of learning 3D modeling in Blender and Pixel art in Aseprite.

And, as you can see, I do some web development! I like working with CSS and HTML but that's about it, I have no clue how to work with JS :D

## <i class="bi bi-briefcase"></i> Works

I mostly create and improve icons for around-GNOME apps, if app doesn't have a translation I do it, sometimes I help with UI design.

Currently member of [Nickvision](https://nickvision.org) and [Gradience](https://gradienceteam.github.io) teams as a designer and maintainer respectively.

Have a look at my [designs](@/design/index.md), mostly icons but also some wallpapers (one of them is even shipped with GNOME)
