## About Me

Hello there! My name is David, you may know me by my online handle Daudix.

> Although Daudix appears to be just my online handle, it's actually a slightly different persona; perhaps more silly and authentic than the "official" David, but it's fine to use whatever you like.

I'm from the Siberian part of Russia, but currently live in <abbr id="abyss" title="If you know, you know">a̸͙͠b̴̛ͅȳ̴̜s̴̫̄s̸̞̒</abbr>.

Things that I like:
- Retro/-futurism and vintage stuff
- Minor details and references
- Smol/indie web
- Photography <small>(although I don't have much opportunity to shoot anything else than a view from my window)</small>
- Design
- Purple <small>(I know, it's shocking)</small>
- Aesthetics:
  - [Vaporwave](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Vaporwave)
  - [Cyberpunk](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberpunk)
  - [Liminal Space](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Liminal_Space)
- Games:
  - Portal series <small>(all-time favorite)</small>
  - The Stanley Parable
  - Superliminal
  - Untitled Goose
  - Stardew Valley
  - Cyberpunk 2077 <small>(I've only *played* it on YouTube)</small>

Design is perhaps a bit more than just a thing I like, it's my hobby and I'm learning more about it every day, although lately I've been a bit burned out.

And, as you can see, I do some web development! I like working with CSS and HTML but that's about it, I have no clue how to work with JS :D

Oh and I'm slightly <span id="shy" onclick="fluttershyAnim()">shy</span>.

## Works

I mostly create and improve icons for around-GNOME apps, if app doesn't have a translation I do it, sometimes I help with UI design.

Currently member of [Nickvision](https://nickvision.org) and [Gradience](https://gradienceteam.github.io) teams as a designer and maintainer respectively.

Have a look at my [designs](@/design/index.md), mostly icons but also some wallpapers (one of them is even shipped with GNOME)

## Small Web

Small Web is something I really like, I'm member of multiple tildes/pubnixes, although I don't do much there yet, I still like to be part of them.

Pubnixes/tildes:

- [exozy.me](https://exozy.me) (most used one by me, really cool thing)
- [envs.net](https://envs.net) (looks promising but I need to figure out the website build pipeline)

Gemini capsules:

- [flounder.online](https://flounder.online) - *finger* me at `daudix@flounder.online`

I also have a website on [neocities.org](https://neocities.org), [check it out](https://daudix.neocities.org).

</div>

> Note: It's recommended to avoid hot-linking; instead place a copy on your own site.

Hey, you, yes, *you*. Got website and a button? I have a deal for you! Just [ping me somewhere](@/find/index.md#contacts) and I'll add it here, piece of cake.

<img id="fluttershy" class="transparent no-hover drop-shadow" src="fluttershy.gif" />

<script type="text/javascript">
	const fluttershy = document.getElementById("fluttershy");

	function fluttershyAnim() {
		fluttershy.classList.add("flying");
		fluttershy.addEventListener("animationend", function () {
			fluttershy.classList.remove("flying");
		});
	}
</script>
