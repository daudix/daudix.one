**I'm originating from Siberia,** but currently residing in <abbr id="abyss" title="If you know, you know">abyss</abbr>. That means that I'm a native Russian speaker, что в каком-то смысле довольно прикольно..?

**Design is my hobby,** and I'm learning more about it every day. I also enjoy doing some web development! I looove working with (S)CSS, HTML, and its templating, but that's about it; JS is a bit of an enigma for me.

**I like to "mess around with things and find out."** I'm very curious, quite enthusiastic, and maybe a little annoying. I am not perfect but I am trying to become a better self each day.

**I'm rather shy.** Quoting [hyperreal](https://hyperreal.coffee) as I can't say it better:

> I'm <button id="shy">shy</button> and might come across as reserved and standoffish at first, but I open up when I get more comfortable with people.
