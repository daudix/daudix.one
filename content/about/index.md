## About

Hello there! My name is David, you can call me by my nickname - Daudix - if you prefer.

I'm from the Siberian part of Russia, but currently live in ▒▓░▒▓░.

I love photography, design, open source and retro-futurism, my
favorite games are «Portal» series, «Untitled Goose» and «The Stanley
Parable».

Design is a bit more than just thing I like, it's my hobby that I
learn more about every day.

I also have some minimal understanding of how Blender works,
occasionally do some silly stuff in it.

## Works

I mostly create and improve icons for around-GNOME apps, if app
doesn't have a translation I do it, sometimes I help with UI design.

Currently member of [Nickvision](https://nickvision.org) and [Gradience](https://gradienceteam.github.io) teams as a designer and maintainer respectively.

I have a project that I'm pretty happy with - [Pixfect](https://codeberg.org/daudix/Pixfect), it's a CLI tool for image dithering, to give images that pixel art look, this project inspired [tfuxu](https://github.com/tfuxu) on creation of [Halftone](https://github.com/tfuxu/Halftone), a beautiful little app.

Have a look at my [designs](design), mostly icons but also some wallpapers :)

Oh and, checkout this cute little animation at [404](/ananas-duck)
