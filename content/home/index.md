**Design is my hobby,** and I'm learning more about it every day. I also enjoy doing some web development! I looove working with CSS/SCSS, HTML, and its templating, but that's about it; JS is a bit of a mystery for me.

**I don't really have a fixed interest,** I just do things and see what's fun. Sometimes so happens that I come across something that consumes me completely, but that doesn't happen all that often, sadly.

**I'm rather shy.** Quoting [Jeffrey](https://hyperreal.coffee/about/) as I can't say it better:

> I'm <button id="shy">shy</button> and might come across as reserved and standoffish at first, but I open up when I get more comfortable with people.

## Works

{{ window() }}

I contribute to various FOSS projects from time to time, either by creating and improving icons, translating them into Russian, or even crafting a logo.

Have a look at my [design page](@/design/index.md) for my design-related works; mostly icons, some wallpapers (one of them is part of GNOME), and a few logos.

## IndieWeb

{{ badges() }}

Simply put, IndieWeb is anything on the web that is hand-crafted and feels personal, at least that's what it is for me.

Everything about it is awesome, from 88x31 buttons to webrings. It also feels cozy and is fun; quite refreshing after the sterile corporate web.

I'm even a member of several tildes and CS clubs, even though I don't do much there, I still like being a part of them:

- [exozyme](https://exozy.me)
- [envs](https://envs.net)

Better yet, I have a website on [neocities](https://neocities.org); essentially it's my playground where I can make bolder design choices than here, and write less interesting and more cringe stuff. [Check it out](https://daudix.neocities.org) if you want to.

I also have a [Gemini capsule](gemini://gmi.daudix.one) on [flounder](https://flounder.online). It's very empty and I have no idea what to use it for ;\_; <small>(you can also _finger_ me at `daudix@flounder.online`)</small>
