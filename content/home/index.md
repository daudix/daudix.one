# David Lapshin { #header }
</div>

Greetings! Name's David, and this is my little corner in the big and scary world wild web. You might know someone named "Daudix", and yeah, that's me :P

{% alert(fact=true) %}
Daudix is actually a slightly different persona; more silly and cringe, yet authentic.
{% end %}

Originating from Siberia, but currently reside in <abbr id="abyss" title="If you know, you know">abyss</abbr>. That means that I'm a native Russian speaker, which is cool I guess?

Other than that, I like to "mess around and find out" about all sorts of things. By nature, I'm very curious, quite enthusiastic, and maybe a little annoying.

I'm also trying to learn something new every day, and sometimes I happen to come across something that consumes me completely, but that doesn't happen all that often... :<

One such thing is design; it's my hobby and I'm learning more about it every day. As you can see, I also do some web development! I looove working with CSS and HTML and its templating, but that's about it; JS is a bit of a mystery for me :D

And lastly, to quote [Jeffrey](https://hyperreal.coffee/about/):

> I’m <button id="shy">shy</button> and might come across as reserved and standoffish at first, but I open up when I get more comfortable with people.

## Works

{{ window() }}

Occasionally I contribute to random FOSS projects, either by creating and improving icons, translating them into Russian, or even crafting a logo.

For my design work, have a look at my [design page](@/design/index.md); it's mostly icons, but also some wallpapers (one of them is part of GNOME) and logos.

## IndieWeb

{{ bumps() }}

Simply put, IndieWeb is anything on the web that is hand-crafted and feels personal, at least that's what it is for me.

Everything about it is awesome, from 88x31 buttons to webrings, it's also cozy and fun; feels refreshing after the sterile corporate web.

I'm even a member of several tildes/pubnixes, even though I don't do much there, I still like being a part of them:

- [exozyme](https://exozy.me)
- [envs](https://envs.net)

Better yet, I have a website on [neocities](https://neocities.org); it's quite empty at the moment, basically it's my playground where I can make bolder design choices than here. [Check it out](https://daudix.neocities.org) if you want.

I also have a [Gemini capsule](gemini://gmi.daudix.one) on [flounder](https://flounder.online). I've recently changed it to serve as a place for jotting down small notes rather than being a mirror of this website. See [this post](@/blog/2024-07-13-repurposing-gemini-capsule/index.md) for the reasons behind this decision. <small>(you can also _finger_ me at `daudix@flounder.online`)</small>
