Greetings! Welcome to my little corner on the World Wild Web. You might know me by my online handle; Daudix.

<div>

I ocasionally contribute to various FOSS projects by creating/improving icons, translating them into Russian, or crafting logos. Other times I make wallpapers for myself that I share with others. <small>(one is in [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org))</small>

## IndieWeb

{{ badges() }}

Simply put, IndieWeb is anything on the web that is hand-crafted and feels personal, at least that's what it is for me.

Everything about it is awesome, from 88x31 buttons to webrings. It also feels cozy and is fun; quite refreshing after the sterile corporate web.

I'm even a member of several tildes and CS clubs, even though I don't do much there, I still like being a part of them:

- [exozyme](https://exozy.me)
- [envs](https://envs.net)

Better yet, I have a website on [neocities](https://neocities.org); essentially it's my playground where I can make bolder design choices than here, and write less interesting and more cringe stuff. [Check it out](https://daudix.neocities.org) if you want to.

I also have a [Gemini capsule](gemini://gmi.daudix.one) on [flounder](https://flounder.online). It's very empty and I have no idea what to use it for ;\_; <small>(you can also _finger_ me at `daudix@flounder.online`)</small>
