As you may know, this blog is powered by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) and a custom theme of mine called [Duckquill](https://duckquill.daudix.one). It was built based on the needs of my website and has a very opinionated set of features and (somewhat) unique design. That was until some time ago, when Duckquill gained more users which requested more features, which moved Duckquill further away from being opinionated to being "one size fits all". Sure, it's very nice to have lots of features and configurations to make it fit your needs, but it also means that I'm now more restricted than ever in terms of changing the look and feel of it. This has been bothering me for a while now (first scrapped draft of this post was written back on Aug 24th), and I've finally decided that it's time.

Starting with Duckquill v6.0.0, which will be released shortly, this website will no longer use Duckquill per se, but rather a hard fork of it, in which I will remove all the features I don't need and add all the ones I do. I also plan to improve the wording or even rewrite most of the pages and create some new ones. All in all, this means that I will have more creative freedom over my website, and for Duckquill it means no more crazy design changes each major release. This doesn't mean however that I will stop working on Duckquill, quite the opposite, I might even port it to some other SSGs now that I don't have to use them myself. It was a pretty tough decision, but it was necessary.

That's it for now! See you in the next one, the rewrite may be done by the time the next post comes out. We'll see.
