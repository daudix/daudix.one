Hii, it's me, the silly little goober, and I'm back in business!

Yippee!

Well, I actually got back at like, Saturday? Anyway, what's important is that I feel better and can continue doing nothing and spending my valuable free time on goofy stuff that doesn't matter nor anyone care-

Even though [my break](@/blog/2024-09-02-taking-a-break/index.md) was pretty short and pathetic (I still checked all the usual online stuff a few times per day) I still did something in the free time:

- Closed all the open Firefox tabs (more than hundred!?) that were collecting dust and [hogging the RAM](https://vmst.io/@daudix/113036721250670891). I know, [shit work](https://zachholman.com/posts/shit-work/), but it had to be done.
- Watched three birds at my window, one flew away relatively quickly, leaving only two, which also flew away after I made an inaccurate move trying to get even closer (I was already very very close).
- Started hoarding and tagging/renaming local music collection, and I have finished it on Tuesday; all is now sorted neatly and named exactly like I want it to, after pointlessly attemptig to manually tag all of it, in the end I just configured MusicBrainz to do it for me, after 5 backup restorations. I still had to manually add cover art to tracks in albums that have unique cover art per track.
- Experimented with my personal branding, this time completely new designs executed in monochrome. About this in the next post later today, I suppose.
- Learned (kind of) [x3dom](https://www.x3dom.org), and even made a [silly little thingy](@/swag/index.md), but then quickly unpublished it, heh (now it's back though).
- Mom and I did some renovation in my room (aka painted walls before potential move).
- Subsequently, I have cleaned all my room and did a bit of moving around, now it [feels more spacey and cozy](https://pleroma.envs.net/notice/Alti2dfyNVw8JHWNSi) (not that it was dirty and uncozy, but still).
- Tried to fix my sleep schedule, it went horribly.

Boring? Maybe. Am I happy? Yea, sorta. Yes.

I thought about playing some video games during my break to distract myself from life, but as you can see it didn't go well, for the better I guess.

Everyone who commented under the [previous post](@/blog/2024-09-02-taking-a-break/index.md) and supported me, I appreciate it, like seriously y'all *super* awesome! Thanks <3

So um... thanks for reading?

Bye.

P.S. Does anyone blog about such silly things? Probably not.
