Ever since the emergence of this website, I’ve blogged rarely and only about stuff that I considered not too boring or "cringy"... Well, it's time to break all that- <mark><span class="audio" style="cursor: pointer;" onclick="playAudio('party-horn.mp3')">PARTY HORN</span></mark>!

Did I just swear? -Anyway.

I've seen my friend [Orbital](https://orbitalmartian.codeberg.page) participate in [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com) challange, and I thought it would be fun to participate in it as well.

> 100 Days To Offload is a challenge to publish 100 posts on your personal blog in a year, no matter what the posts are about.

There are more reasons why I decided to participate in this challenge:

- It's a perfect opportunity for a tone shift towards a less formal one (you might've noticed this in the [previous post](@/blog/rewriting-neocities-website/index.md))
- Sometimes I need to vent about stuff that interest me, which I currently do by bugging my friends in a group chat. That isn't ideal.
- I love writing and want to get better at it, which isn’t possible without, well, writing.
- An empty blog makes me very sad.
- My drafts folder is overflowing.

And so, the [previous post](@/blog/rewriting-neocities-website/index.md) started it all!

Don't know how long I'll last, but still it's worth giving it a shot!
