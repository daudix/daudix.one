I can't write.  
I have to write.  
I suck at writing.  
I want to, but can't.  
What should I write about.  

These are my constant thoughts since I started this goddamn challenge, and it's been sucking my energy quite a bit. I am far behind the graph, instead of publishing 8 posts a month, I only published 9 in two, the quality is not as high as I would like it to be, all the drafts I had don't seem as exiting as I though they are.

It's time to change the strategy a bit.

Introducing... filler ~~episodes~~ posts!

Wait, my entire life is a filler epi- *cough from behind* ah right, enough depressive stuff.

I've been thinking about and been suggested by some to post "juicy" posts once in two weeks or even month; "so that you know that you have a whooping two free weeks to write it, and while it's being written, something more boring can be published." This seems like the only sensible solution to the "quality versus quantity" dilemma, and an excuse for myself.

That's right, this post is one of these filler ones; it's been written in one go with virtually no proofreading :3

See you in the next one and have a good \[SUBJECT CURRENT TIME HERE\]!
