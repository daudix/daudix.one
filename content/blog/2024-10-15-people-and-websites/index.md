This came as a surprise to me, a good one; I've been interviewed by [Jakov](https://sheepdev.xyz) on the recommendation of [Ivan](https://libreivan.com). It's been quite fun reading the previous editions of the "People and Websites" series and writing this one. It covers a bit of my and my website's backstory, some of which I've already shared here, but nonetheless there's some exclusive stuff, so give it and the other editions of the series a read:

If you want to comment on the interview itself, I'd recommend doing so at [Jakov's post](https://social.sheepdev.xyz/@sheep/statuses/01JA7Q3MWS34XKASF431T6HZ57) ;)
