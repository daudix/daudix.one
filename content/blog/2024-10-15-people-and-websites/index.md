This came as a surprise to me, a good one; I've been interviewed by [Jakov](https://sheepdev.xyz) on the recommendation of [Ivan](https://ivanmarkov.net). It's been quite fun reading the previous editions of the "People and Websites" series and writing this one. It covers a bit of my and my website's backstory, some of which I've already shared here, but nonetheless there's some exclusive stuff, so give it and the other editions of the series a read:

{% alert(icon="pencil-simple", title="Edit") %}
**2026-02-19:** Jakov let me know that his old domain---sheepdev.xyz---have expired and now he's using a different one. I have updated the link accordingly. social.sheepdev.xyz no longer exists, so I removed the mention of it as a place for commenting on the interview.
