Hiya! It was a long time since the last post/entry, and main blog isn't much better, but this post isn't about this, but about my new IRL journal.

Yester-yesterday I've got myself a new journal, not just any but *purple*, which automatically makes it 20% cooler.

![Smooth, "folded in half A4 sheet" sized journal, on top of which there's a purple gel pen and a short (half the length of a normal one) purple highlighter.](PXL_20250105_194719657.jpg)

And yesterday I got some markers, highlighters, pencils, erasers, bookmarks, and such, and started decorating it. Turned out a bit meh, but who makes something perfect from the first try? I did so together with my sister and mom, who got same journals but dark blue as there weren't any nice colors in stock. Of course theirs turned out much better :P

I'll write it in English and not my native language, Russian, as I read and write (and think 0_0) in English *much* more than in Russian. I doubt I'll actually use it for longer than three days, but maybe a miracle will happen and it won't happen; after all I'm using physical calendar for half a year plus, so it's something.

![Two pages visible, on first there's month title, mini monthly calendar, to-do and goals fields, weather tracking thingy (which is a calendar with some space for colored squares which represent some specific weather condition), and on the second there's sleep tracker, which is the same as weather tracker but instead of weather conditions it represents amount of sleep. Some pens and such is visible in the background.](PXL_20250106_233408295.jpg)

So yeah, I had lots of fun doing this, though at times it was pretty frustrating, I've done the sleep tracker wrong (I wanted to do it differently but forgot up until I finished the current one), and I still didn't make the yearly goals page. Nonetheless, it's a pretty nice start of moving my planning offline, and thus reducing my screen time more, which I might write about on my main blog.

I'm still unsure on how to move my to-do's from digital to it, in what order, how much pages should I leave for them, should I make daily to-dos, and etc. Hopefully I'll figure it out somehow.

Oh and, barely related fun fact: laces on my shoes are... purple! I absolutely looove the way they look, and I've been going with for 7 months already. Obviously I didn't buy them like that.

P.S. omgomgomg this post is so cringy aaa
