Hi, welcome to the first post of '25. Still nothing interesting to write about, so here we are, writing about myself again.

## Main and Alt Accounts

Before we start, let's get on the same page regarding the definition of "main" and "alt" accounts:

- Main account is where I post things that I'm okay with anyone seeing.
- Alt account is for everything else, be it a silly meme, shitpost, or vent post.

> Most people use alt accounts for NSFW stuff, but obviously that's not the case for me, just to make this very clear, m'kay?

So, almost a year ago I've written a [post](@/blog/2024-01-23-alt-profile-on-akkoma/index.md) about my new alt account on Fediverse, and here I am to make some changes to this. I've created it mostly to try out new for me Fediverse software called Akkoma with emoji reactions and rich formatting. The thing with posting more silly stuff and following folks that post 10 posts a minute came later on.

## Reality of Having an Alt

On the surface, having an alt makes sense; if one wants to see serious posts they follow the main, and if they want to see everything else they follow the alt as well. However in reality everything is a tad bit different; I don't have anything serious to post on main except for blog post announcements and some <abbr title="Content Warning">CW</abbr>ed web dev insights. I got bored by scrolling my own account, it's this bad.

As for the alt, I'm not exactly an avid shitposter nor meme-gun, I don't follow anyone following whom would be embarrassing on main, and folks I follow leak to the timeline of main anyways (in form of boosts or followed hashtags).

## The Rug Issue

There's also much bigger issue: <span class="spoiler">I got tired of shoving my real self under different rugs, be it an alt account, Neocities [site](https://daudix.neocities.org), and whatnot. I am tired of trying to keep a decent "image" of myself, like I'm some sort of politician/celebrity, tired of trying to impress someone, even though no one really cares, trying to blend in, be what others want me to be in my opinion. Is it really me if I constantly stop myself from saying something?</span>

*Cough...* Anyways, back to the main storyline.

## World That Is Wet and Dry

Recently I remembered about my old [wetdry.world](https://wetdry.world/@daudix) account. It runs a modification of Mastodon called [Chuckya](https://github.com/TheEssem/mastodon) (which itself is a fork of [Glitch](https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon)) that adds some neat features such as rich formatting and emoji reactions, which is exactly why I tried Akkoma in the first place.

And so I thought, "why not, why shouldn't I try using it", and so I did; I followed all the folks I followed on Akkoma alt and basically switched to it full time, and... I really liked it! Federation (connection with other Fediverse servers) is good, local timeline is lively and fun, and it has all the custom emojis I would need, while not having too much of them like Akkoma alt does, it's a Mastodon instance, which I prefer to Akkoma, and more importantly it's filled to the brim with very cool people. It even has an Akkoma frontend, which is really cool.

## Bridge to the Sky

There's also a small issue with otherwise perfectly fine vmst.io: it blocks [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy) that allows bridging your Fediverse account to Bluesky. I really don't understand why it does so.

Otherwise, it's a really good instance that I would recommend to anyone that wants a stable instance with vanilla Mastodon.

## Conclusion

So, after much thought and consideration, I have decided to move my main account, which is currently on [vmst.io](https://vmst.io/@daudix), to wetdry.world, merging the two.

In terms of branding, I will use my formal one for now, but this may change later. As for the tone, I'll keep the current tone of alt, so basically it'll be a bit more informal. Follows will continue being closed as I like it better that way, but feel free to send a follow request. I apologize in advance for the upcoming migration notifications. Of course this alone won't solve the " rug problem", but it's a step in that direction.

I know what you're thinking right now: "Ugh, does this guy really have nothing better to do than move his social media profiles around? Who cares about Fediverse? Even then, why blog about it?" and you'll be right, I'm not amused either.

Another thing I've been thinking about is merging my [Journal](https://daudix.neocities.org/journal/) with this blog, the reasoning behind this is the same as behind merging the alt and main accounts, but the decision is up to *you*, there's a poll on the [Blog](@/blog/_index.md) page where you can choose its fate. It ends on January 16th. There's still plenty of fun stuff I can do with the Neocities site besides journal, so it won't be too much of a loss.

That's all for now. Thanks for reading through my ramblings, and see you in the next one!
