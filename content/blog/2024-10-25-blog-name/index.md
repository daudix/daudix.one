This post is just as spontaneous as the name itself.

You probably saw it already, but if not, this blog is now called "Progressive Enhancement".

[Progressive Enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) is a web dev term that means that a certain website provides all the essential features to as many users as possible, while providing the full and best experience to users of modern browsers. This term fits my blog well, as this whole blog is progressively enhanced, and so is my writing over time. Baby steps, but steps nonetheless.

Just wanted to share this here, plus I'm late on schedule this week (just like any other week), so I kinda had to post something.

That's it for now, take care.
