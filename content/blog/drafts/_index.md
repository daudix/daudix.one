# Daudix's Drafts

Um... you shouldn't be here... How did you even get here? <img class="emoji no-hover" alt="trixie concern" src="trixie-concern.webp" />

This page is only supposed to exist for those to whom I sent draf- oooh, I see, I sent you the draft and you felt like exploring a bit, changed the URL and came here, silly me haha.

W-what? You came here by yourself? in that case I recommend to go somewhere the navbar points to, here you won't find anything valuable, just half-finished, half-shit drafts. <button id="at-best" onclick="atBest()">At best</button>.

<p id="bookshelf">
What are you looking for? Some kind of hidden lever in the bookshelf? Come on, there's already plenty of Easter eggs on this website.
</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
  const bookshelf = document.getElementById("bookshelf");

  function atBest() {
    bookshelf.classList.add("active");
  }
</script>
