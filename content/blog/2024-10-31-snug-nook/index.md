So, what silly thing I came up this time? When I'll post about something interesting? Why don't I sit and do something useful?

Answer to the first question is this very post.

I had this idea sitting in my to-do for like, a few months? Before that it was sitting in my head. Ever sice the [death of Gradience](@/blog/2024-07-18-archiving-gradience/index.md) I've been missing the Water Cooler off-topic chat. Sure, There are friend GCs, but it's not the same thing as semi-public server that anyone can join.

And so, in 29'th of this month I decided to finally give it a shot, and I've setup a Discord server titled "Daudix's Snug Nook". The next day I've bridged it to a Matrix space with the same name, and yeah, it kept on rolling; I've added some bots, removed them, setup onboarding, disabled it, annoyed [envs.net](https://envs.net) mods... Long story short, I had lots of fun.

Once it was in a usable state (channel/room permissions are correct, basic rules are written) I shared [the link](@/snug-nook/index.md) with my friends, and two of them joined it (thanks <3). There were some issues with the "Abuse Management" bot that is actually not a bot (wtf) that I hope are now resolved, and the Matrix <-> Discord bridge seems pretty stable.

So here I am, officially announcing it!

Behold, The [Snug Nook](@/snug-nook/index.md); the cozy, welcoming, and friendly chat that no one asked for. This is also where I'll post some updates on Duckquill and this Website; there are separate channels for them, and even a role that you can assign yourself to get notifications on important updates (Discord only, Matrix doesn't have roles yet).

See you there (if you're interested) and to the next time!

P.S. No, I don't like the state of this blog, yes, I'm aware that it's boring and maybe even annoying, and yes, I've noticed that the posts are getting shorter and shorter, the thing is, I don't really have anything to write about; interesting things don't happen every day, and stuff I'd like to write about are either cringe or not interesting, and you know that the interest bar is already very low, so you can imagine.

P.P.S. Guess what, after writing all this and starting making banner for this post, I've found out that the "Abuse Management" bot have gone completely insane and started removing all messages sent from Discord, so I had to create a new Matrix space and re-bridge and reconfigure everything from scratch, this time without this fucking bot. On top of that the space is no longer publicly discoverable and is invite-only, just like Discord server.
