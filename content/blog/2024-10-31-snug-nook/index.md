So, what silly thing I came up this time? When I'll post about something interesting? Why don't I sit and do something useful?

Answer to the first question is this very post.

I had this idea sitting in my to-do for like, a few months? Before that it was spinning in my head. Ever since the [death of Gradience](@/blog/2024-07-18-archiving-gradience/index.md) I've been missing the "Water Cooler" off-topic chat. Sure, there are friend <abbr title="Group Chats">GCs</abbr>, but it's not the same thing as semi-public server that anyone can join.

And so, on 29'th of this month (yeah, I like precise dates) I decided to finally give it a shot, and I've setup a Discord server titled "Daudix's Snug Nook". The next day I've bridged it to a Matrix space with the same name, and yeah, it kept on rolling; I've added some bots, removed them, setup onboarding, disabled it, annoyed [envs.net](https://envs.net) mods[^1]... Long story short, I had lots of fun.

Once it was in a usable state (channel/room permissions are correct, basic rules are written), I shared [the link](@/snug-nook/index.md) with my friends, and three of them joined (thanks <3). There were some issues with the "Abuse Management" bot, which isn't really a bot but more of a semi-bot (wtf), which went *completely insane* and started removing all messages sent from discord and even some matrix ones, and since it had admin permissions we couldn't just kick it, so we had to create a brand new space, set everything up, and invite everyone back there. I also renamed it to just "Snug Nook" without the "Daudix's" prefix. Everything should be fine now, and the Matrix â†” Discord bridge seems pretty stable, for now...

So here I am, officially announcing it!

Behold, the [Snug Nook](@/snug-nook/index.md); the cozy, welcoming, and friendly chat no one ever asked for. This is also where I'll be posting some updates about Duckquill and this website; there are separate channels for each, and even a role you can assign yourself to get notifications about important updates (Discord only, Matrix doesn't have roles yet).

See you there (if you're interested) and until next time!

P.S. No, I don't like the state of this blog, yes, I'm aware that it's boring and maybe even annoying, and yes, I've noticed that the posts are getting shorter and shorter, the thing is, I don't really have anything to write about; interesting things don't happen every day, and stuff I'd like to write about are either cringe or not interesting, and you know that the interest bar is already very low, so you can imagine.

[^1]: In the process of setting up the Matrix mirror and adding the "Abuse Management" bot, I managed to get on the nerves of the homerver moderator because the bot is in fact not a bot and is manually added and approved, so I got called out publicly. As usual, I'm unintentionally causing trouble in the process of doing something, classic me.
