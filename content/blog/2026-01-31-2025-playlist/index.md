A lot can be said about 2025. It was hard, fun, interesting, and chaotic. Thankfully, though, this isn't a year in review; rather, it's a year of _music_ in review. I wanted to encapsulate my musical preferences this year in the form of a carefully curated playlist. I hope you enjoy!

## Where To Find

You can find the original playlist on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7zbBvAvpb9NJfkO0e7lJx3), additionally you can listen to most of it on YouTube and Apple Music via [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/daudix/playlists/14485052).

## Premise

> [!WARNING]
> Spoiler alert! If you want to listen to the playlist first without spoiling the intrigue, do so now.

The playlist premise is rather simple and as follows:

- Start off slow, go all hopeful and positive, mostly niche indie music
- Add multiple "sudden emotional pits" to keep things interesting, more so being more of a metaphorical thing
- Reach catharsis with some well known songs
- Rapidly reduce energy afterwards
- End with something beautiful

![Graph chart with three criteria: BPM, Energy, and Loud (Db). BPM goes up and down with regular intervals relatively smoothly, Energy goes from low to high, with three drops in the first half, and Loud (Db) is smooth except in the places of said Energy drops.](graph.png)

Additionally, I have set a limit for myself because otherwise the playlist would be way too long: only two (2) songs are permitted per artist. Might sound like an easy enough limitation but it's really not, it was hard to only choose two songs from artists that I like :c

## Playlist Contents

Anyhoo, let's see what I think of each track and why it's in the position it is in the playlist:

> [!NOTE]
> This section is pretty raw still, See [conclusion](#conclusion) for an explanation as to why it's so rushed.

1. **Good Morning:** A perfect fit for a first track made by someone I know; starts off slow and calm, then goes all hopeful and positive. Think an alarm clock that starts off your day. I recommend checking it and other songs out on gifting guide [Bandcamp](https://giftingguide.bandcamp.com)
2. **On Little Cat Feet:** Continuing, now with a bit less positive and slightly more anxious/confused/lost but still hopeful track from one of my favorite games ever---OneShot.
3. **Take Responsibility (Hear Me):** Continuing, depressing lyrics about sensitive topic, but still upbeat. First track with lyrics and nice vocals by Koa.
4. **Loving forever:** Returning back to positivity with OneShot-like piano in the start and rather unique instrumental closer to the middle. Check out other Azure Comet's songs, they're nice.
5. **Background pt. 1:** Koa again, with fun instrumental and angsty lyrics. I recommend checking some other songs from this album.
6. **Already Dead:** Caught my attention with how unique and intense it is, don't mind the fact that it's a "FNaF song", it's a bop.
7. **Forgotten:** First exceptionally-crafted emotional pit, with this cool noisy/grainy texture. Other Maebi's works have a similar feeling to them.
8. **Summer's Gone:** Azure Comet again, with sentimental lyrics and interesting instrumental.
9. **Cheerleader:** Going back on the upbeat positive and fun track with _gasp_ Porter Robinson :O
10. **Von dutch:** Preparing the ground for hyperpop with catchy song by Charli. Didn't know that the music video is _this_ vulgar until I made this playlist :/
11. **1999:** I just wanna go back, go back to 1999, wanna go back wanna go- ahem, yeah it's catchy too.
12. **ANGELFISH (loser say what?):** First track by my favorite artist, Vylet Pony, with nice vocals from Namii.
13. **microchip:** BAHAHAHAHA what the hell was that omggg :sob: It's like, if Gir was a track he'd sound like this.
14. **Nightmare Night:** Back at Vylet, really liked the way this sounded for some reason.
15. **What I Want:** Suuuper unique, I don't think I heard anything quite like this before. Chopped up vocals sound interesting.
16. **Killing the Mercy:** Oooo German music oooo.
17. **WE ARE SO BACK:** First songg by availax, an artist I randomly came across and work of whom I fell in love with. You can listen to their entire discography and it'll be all peak.
18. **U Love It:** Something different for a change, - dynamic vulgar slutcore song that I found in one such playlist by someone I met online.
19. **Locals (Girls like us) \[with gabby start\]:** Arms, body, legs, flesh, skin, sinew, good luck.
20. **yeah!:** hyperpop I guess but also I wound't say it's really hyperpop? In any case availax cooked.
21. **Lick a Rock:** Second gifting guide track, here because of the fun name (not really but it is fun).
22. **Solace:** Second emotional pit by the same artists and from the same album as the first.
23. **Takedown:** I couldn't not add KPDH song considering it's 2025 playlist.
24. **Lazuli:** Banger upbeat song by Artifyber. My favorite song of theirs, actually. Yeah I know, it can be surprising that they also make music.
25. **Antonymph - Zizkil Remix:** I kind of cheated here by including third Vylet Pony song but imo it's so so different from the original that it can grant it's spot as a standalone song. Truly an incredible re-imagination of an already banger song.
26. **The Ghost of You:** Song about war, losing people close to you, PTSD, and substance abuse. Most of that isn't present in the song itself, rather than in a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCUpvTMis-Y) which by itself could be considered a cinematic masterpiece.
27. **Ich will:** A classic. Included it here because I learned that my dad used to listen to it while beating the crap out of punching bag in his prime.
28. **You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison:** I initially wanted to include Helena as second MCR song, but due to recent events I decided to substitute it with other song I like.
29. **That's My Floor:** Hard to explain but the beginning gives me ENA: Dream BBQ vibes.
30. **Affection Addiction:** Recommendation from a friend.
31. **Military Fashion Show:** Ditto.
32. **Shotgun Blues:** Ditto.
33. **Monster:** Ditto?
34. **Confronting Myself:** Goes _crazy hard_.
35. **King For A Day:** Recommendation from a friend.
36. **The Only:** Found this song via NFS: Underground, a game we used to play with my dad a couple years ago, which he used to play back in the day. He's well and sound btw, don't worry.
37. **Around the World (La La La La La):** Another one of them older songs, good luck not getting this stuck playing in your head for a couple of days :]
38. **Toxicity:** Song about ADHD apparently. Cool. Also a recommendation from a friend.
39. **The Emptiness Machine:** Ditto.
40. **Going Under:** Emo 2000s yeahhh. Also [check this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czLYl4fM8yk)
41. **Numb:** Link in Park. Mom used to listen to them (she's well and sound too).
42. **Look at the Sky:** Closing with a song about going and living despite everything.
43. **Ballade pour Adeline:** Closing off with a beautiful song recommended by a friend.

43 songs. 2 hours 24 minutes of playback. Crazy right?
Also did you know that I like the number 43? Initially this playlist only had 38 songs, but I remembered some more songs I wanted to add so it became that accidentally.

## Playlist But As a Table

Because why not, plus it has a bit more info.

## Conclusion

This project took be quite some time to cook up, but as to blog post it was thrown together in a day, the reason for the rush is that I wanted to finish this to-do item before the end of January, first month of the year, because afterwards it won't really count as start of the year, and won't be as cool.

I will likely make a bunch of post publication edits, and when I'm done I'll let you know here.

Sooo yea, first blog post of 2026, exciting huh? Next blog post is in the works but you know how it usually goes, so I won't promise when it'll be out or if it will be out in the first place.

Thanks for reading through this huge pile of disjointed words, I hope it was somewhat fun and I'll see you in the next one. Stay healthy and say your loved ones that you love them.
