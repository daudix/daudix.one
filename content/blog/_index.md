Here I write about my projects, updates on them, life, things that bother me, and pretty much anything else that spins around in my head and gets to be written down and is not too cringey, in which case I write it in my [journal](https://daudix.neocities.org/journal/).

So, grab a cup of your favorite beverage and enjoy the read! <small>(or don't, my writing is pretty shitty)</small>
