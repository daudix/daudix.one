Hii! Welcome to my little blog!

<details>
<summary>Why such a stupid name?</summary>

[Progressive Enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) is a web dev term that means that a certain website provides all the essential features to as many users as possible, while providing the full and best experience to users of modern browsers. This term fits my blog well, as this whole blog is progressively enhanced, and so is my writing over time. Baby steps, but steps nonetheless.
</details>

Here I write about software, FOSS, life, things that bother me, and pretty much anything else that spins around in my head and gets to be written down.

So, grab a cup of your favorite beverage and enjoy the read! <small>(or don't, my writing is pretty shitty)</small>
