Howdy! Welcome to my little blog!

Here I write about software, FOSS, life, things that bother me, and pretty much anything else that spins around in my head and gets to be written down.

So, grab a cup of your favorite beverage enjoy the read! <small>(or don't, my writing is pretty shitty)</small>
