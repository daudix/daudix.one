In the last couple of days I've been feeling worse than usual, I'd say it might be the worst I've felt in a long time, and it seems like this feeling doesn't want to go away easily, so I think I'm going to take a short (or not so) break from as many things as I can; Fediverse, Discord, Matrix, email, you name it. There's nothing urgent going on there, so I'm just not going to check them. I honestly have no idea why I'm feeling this way, I can't think of any reasonable reason, and that makes me even sadder; there are people who have actual reasons to feel bad, but they don't, and then there's me, feeling like shit for no fucking reason.

Anyhoo, see you in the next one!
