This blog was born two month ago, and since the first revision a lot- no, that's not enough, **hella lot** of stuff has been changed, tweaked and redone from scratch, so here I will list them and my plans for the future of this blog.

## ¬´The Index¬ª

The Index is not only home page, it's also a showcase, info and screensaver pages, they all live in the same `pages` repository, while blog is a completely separate thing with its own repository.

One important change have happened to the Index, now all its pages use the same base, `style.css`, and only page-specific tweaks are specified in page <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, e.g showcase page style has `@import url("style.css");` in the beginning instead of exact copy of `index.css`, not only this makes the file size smaller, but also makes the tweaking process a breeze, since stuff can be changed in one place and be applied to every page.

### Home

Home page is a very important page, this page links to all other pages, it gives some basic info about me and some contact links. It didn't change a lot but there are some work been done.

- Proper dark mode have been implemented (well, it were already there but I replaced it with filter hack,more on it in blog section. Now it's enabled back and all the custom stuff have been fixed to support it)
- Background color are a bit different (taken from Libadwaita)
- Added shadows to all cards to give them some depth

- Active state for cards (when you click/press on card) have been removed since it looked weird

And more, these are that I could remember.

### Showcase

Showcase have been updated to include more icons, info overlay closing animation have been fixed (previously it just disappeared without any animation) and assets were optimized.

### Info

Info page were completely redesigned, inspired by the design of [Felipe  
Kinoshita's](https://felipekinoshita.com) site. It is more similar to the blog in terms of typography, has nice animated stripes background and a lot of info about me. Compared to the previous version it has way less links - only ones that I actually use.

### Screensaver

Screensaver is a brand-new page, the name is self-explanatory, it's just a pretty screensaver with colorful circles floating around, it is made around [this codepen](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/qBMMyxz) by [√Ålvaro](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo), from interesting it has ¬´Enter Fulllscreen¬ª button.

## ¬´The Blog¬ª

The blog have seen the most of the changes, it all were flipped upside down to be prettier, and as fast as before.

- Proper dark mode have been implemented from scratch, previously <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> invert filter with hue rotation were used, it worked but had too much issues: images became unsaturated, emojis creepy, shadows glowing and etc.
- Navigation bar have been added, it has pretty glassy look and shadow. Inspired by the navigation bar of [Micah Ilbery's](https://micahilbery.com) site. I really like how it looks :3

- Added <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> style, now instead of boring code block it uses pretty gradient fill and has this neon glow on hover

<figcaption>...And in dark</figcaption>

- Some colors have been changed, all in all should be more pleasant to the eye
- Everything now respects global variables, so e.g you can change accent color, roundness, shadows and maximum content width without going through the whole 1200+ <abbr title="Lines Of Code">LOC</abbr> <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, this is made not only to keep myself sane but also for _you_ to make it easier to build upon ;)

## One More Thing‚Ñ¢

ü•Å [Drum roll ‚ñª](<javascript:onclick=playAudio('drum-roll-gaming-sound-effect-hd.mp3');>) I have a new site at Neocities! it will not replace this one, it's just a silly playground that has this old look. You know... Geocities and stuff.

It's empty <abbr title="At The Moment">ATM</abbr>, but it has [AD-HD button](https://mstdn.social/@Daudix/110872543493210479)!

[Visit it here](https://daudix.neocities.org)

## The Future

We'll see, I plan to publish more posts, at least I have an idea for the next one, I'm thinking about making the whole blog a Jekyll template (Duck Template, DuckQuill), but this will mean that I'll need to maintain one more site basically, not sure really, I could sync it with this blog once a month so it doesn't annoy much, idk, will see.

## Conclusion

Phew, that's a lot, 2 months of work! truly happy how it all comes up, hope you too, this is most long-lived site thingy yet, I have learned a lot about <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, and I really like doing this!
