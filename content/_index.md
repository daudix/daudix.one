This page is currently under construction.  
I decided to merge the "about" and "home" pages, since the latter was rather empty.  
This is also an opportunity to do some redesign, so yeah, beware of dragons!  
(some dragons are pretty cute though)

# David Lapshin { #header }

Greetings! Name's David, you may also know me by my online handle; Daudix.

{% alert(fact=true) %}
Although Daudix appears to be just my online handle, it's actually a slightly different persona; perhaps more silly and authentic than the "official" David, but it's fine to use whatever you like.

I try to learn something new every day, and sometimes, I come across things that I enjoy and start to dive into them.

Take design; it's more than just something I like, it's my hobby and I'm learning more about it every day, although lately I've been a bit burned out.

Ss you can see, I also do some web development! I like working with CSS and HTML, but that's about it; JS is a bit of a mystery for me :D

And lastly, to quote [Jeffrey](https://hyperreal.coffee/about/): "I’m <button id="shy" onclick="fluttershyAnim()">shy</button> and might come across as reserved and standoffish at first, but I open up when I get more comfortable with people."

## Works

I mostly create and improve icons for around-GNOME apps, if app doesn't have a translation I do it, sometimes I help with UI design.

Have a look at my [designs](@/design/index.md); mostly icons, but also some wallpapers (one of them is part of GNOME).

## Small Web

Small Web is something I really like, I'm member of multiple tildes/pubnixes, although I don't do much there yet, I still like to be part of them.

Pubnixes/tildes:

- [exozyme](https://exozy.me)
- [envs](https://envs.net)

I have an alt website on [neocities](https://neocities.org), [check it out](https://daudix.neocities.org).

I also have a [Gemini capsule](gemini://gmi.daudix.one) on [flounder](https://flounder.online), but I recently changed it to serve as a place for jotting down small notes rather than being a mirror of this website. See [this post](@/blog/2024-07-13-repurposing-gemini-capsule/index.md) for the reasons behind this decision. <small>(you can also *finger* me at `daudix@flounder.online`)</small>

If you like my website, feel free to link it by adding one of these buttons:

<div class="buttons-container">

{% alert(note=true) %}
It's recommended to avoid hot-linking; instead, place a copy on your own site.

Hey, you, yes, *you*. Got a website and a button? Just a button? I got a deal for you! [Ping me somewhere](@/find/index.md#contacts) so I can add it here, easy as pie!
