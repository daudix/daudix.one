Greetings! Name's David, you may also know me by my online handle; Daudix.

{% alert(fact=true) %}
Although Daudix appears to be just my online handle, it's actually a slightly different persona; perhaps more silly and authentic than the "official" David, but it's fine to use whatever you like.

</details>

I try to learn something new every day, and sometimes, I come across things that I enjoy and start to dive into them.

Take design; it's more than just something I like, it's my hobby and I'm learning more about it every day, although lately I've been a bit burned out.

As you can see, I also do some web development! I like working with CSS and HTML, but that's about it; JS is a bit of a mystery for me :D

And lastly, to quote [Jeffrey](https://hyperreal.coffee/about/): "I’m <button id="shy">shy</button> and might come across as reserved and standoffish at first, but I open up when I get more comfortable with people."

## Works

{{ window() }}

I occasionally contribute to FOSS projects, mostly around GNOME apps; creating and improving icons for them, translating them into Russian, and sometimes helping with the UI.

Have a look at my [designs](@/design/index.md); mostly icons, but also some wallpapers (one of them is part of GNOME).

## IndieWeb

{{ bumps() }}

IndieWeb is something I really like; everything from 88x31 buttons to webrings is so cozy, fun, legit and personal, feels really great after the sterile corporate web all over the place. I'm even a member of several tildes/pubnixes, even though I don't do much there, I still like being a part of them:

- [exozyme](https://exozy.me)
- [envs](https://envs.net)

I have a website on [neocities](https://neocities.org); it's a bit empty at the moment, basically it's my playground where I can make bolder design choices than here. [Check it out](https://daudix.neocities.org).

I also have a [Gemini capsule](gemini://gmi.daudix.one) on [flounder](https://flounder.online). I recently changed it to serve as a place for jotting down small notes rather than being a mirror of this website. See [this post](@/blog/2024-07-13-repurposing-gemini-capsule/index.md) for the reasons behind this decision. <small>(you can also _finger_ me at `daudix@flounder.online`)</small>
