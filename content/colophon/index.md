# Colophon

{% alert(fact=true) %}
This is the least fun page on this website. Deal with it.
{% end %}

This website is a passion project of mine; it's made with a lot of love and attention to detail (I bet you've noticed that already), is constantly updated and improved, and tries to be (somewhat) lightweight and compatible with older browsers. <small>(at very least it works on iOS 15 and macOS High Sierra; which I'm sure a lot of people still use)</small>

It used to be hosted on [GitHub pages](https://web.archive.org/web/20221030010150/https://daudix-ufo.github.io/), then on [Codeberg Pages](https://daudix.one), then on [exozy.me](https://daudix.exozy.me), and now it's hosted on Codeberg Pages again.

<details><summary>Why all this hosting mess?</summary>

Well, at first I [migrated to Codeberg](@/blog/2023-07-15-migration-from-github-to-codeberg/index.md), then I joined [exozyme](https://exozy.me) which provided way faster CI and overall easier workflow, in addition to prettier domain, but then I found out that only exozyme members can open issues/pull requests on [exogit](https://git.exozy.me), which isn't good for a FOSS project like [Duckquill](https://duckquill.daudix.one), so I have set up a two-way mirror at [Forgejo Next](https://next.forgejo.org), since [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) doesn't allow two-way mirrors to prevent high load on infrastructure. Everything worked well until one day, when Forgejo Next wiped *all the data*; accounts and repos. I had to do something, and so I moved back to Codeberg.
