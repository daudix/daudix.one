This website is a passion project of mine, made with a lot of love and attention to details, is constantly updated and improved, and has the goal of being lightweight and somewhat compatible with older browsers. <small>(at very least most stuff works on iOS 15 and macOS High Sierra; which unfortunately a lot of people still use)</small>

It is currently hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), and I like it so far. Before that it used to be hosted on [Codeberg Pages](https://codeberg.page), [exozyme](https://exozy.me), and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
