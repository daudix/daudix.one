This website is a passion project of mine; it's made with (a lot of) love and attention to details (I bet you've noticed that already), is constantly updated and improved, and tries to be (somewhat) lightweight and compatible with older browsers. <small>(at very least most stuff works on iOS 15 and macOS High Sierra; which unfortunately a lot of people still use)</small>

It is currently hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), and I like it so far. Before that, it used to be hosted on [Codeberg Pages](https://codeberg.page), [exozyme](https://exozy.me), and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
